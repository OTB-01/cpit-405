When2Meet Clone: HTML-based Scheduling Application


We are going to build a web application for scheduling that lets users make events, input their availability, and discover shared free times among participants. The web app should resemble a simplified version of When2Meet with basic HTML layout and a straightforward design. The goal is to create a web app that closely resembles the screenshot provided below. Please submit a link to your GitHub pages.
